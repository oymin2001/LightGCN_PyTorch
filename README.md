# LightGCN with PyTorch ðŸš€

This repository implements the **Light Graph Convolutional Network (LightGCN)** for recommendation systems using PyTorch. The implementation is based on the [LightGCN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02126) and focuses on **memory efficiency** and **scalability** for large-scale datasets.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Chunk-wise DataLoader**: Efficiently computes the adjacency matrix for massive datasets.
- **Scalable Evaluation**: Metrics like **Recall**, **Precision**, **NDCG**, and **MAP** are calculated in chunks to handle large-scale data.
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metric evaluation for each training epoch.

## ðŸ“Š Results
Below is the model performance over **30 epochs**:

- **Metrics Evaluated**:  
  - **Recall@20**  
  - **Precision@20**  
  - **NDCG@20**  
  - **MAP@20**  

The graph shows steady improvement, especially in Recall and NDCG, while other metrics follow a consistent upward trend.
